    <h1>My name is Taylor</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I currently live in Naples, FL. I have a BA in Biblical studies and am currently in the last semester (yay!) of my MA in Global Strategic Communications and a Graduate Certificate in Web Design, which is why I am in this class. My professional career started in administration with an organization that needed a lot of things, one of which was someone to do graphic design. I picked up that hat because it interested me and it turned into much more than that! Since then I have worked in marketing for small business, done some freelance design work, and am currently an in-house art director for a local church.</p>

    <h2>For Fun</h2>
        <p>My time outside of work/school is split between my family and friends. I'm a happy dog-aunt of the cutest pup in the world. My favorite pass-time is playing Dungeons & Dragons with friends. I never thought that I would be that person, but it turns out that group storytelling has been one of the best parts of the last couple years. It's been a great chance to keep in touch with friends (through a time when face-to-face interaction was at a low) and explore elements of social interaction and storytelling as I study these things in school as well!</p>

    <h2>Career Goals</h2>
        <p>I'm anticipating this course to be one of the more challenging ones that I've taken! This is my last course for the certificate in Web Design, and while the others (covering Adobe programs) have been technical in nature, I'm a designer by trade, so they weren't as challenging as they would have been had I no experience with the programs. With this class, however, I'm starting from scratch! I've always wanted to learn some coding, so I'm looking forward to it with a small amount of wariness and a lot of anticipation!.</p>

      <h3>Current Work</h3>
         <p>I currently work for a local church that has just recently gone through a rebrand. In fact, we just launched the logo and new about a month ago and are slowly rolling out the rest of our changes over the summer (our slower months). We're very excited about the updates and a lot of my own effort has gone into developing the new brand and style guide as well as the content and copy on the website. 95% of the photos on the website were taken by myself and our team has put in a lot of collaborative hours to get the site to where it is now. We are still evaluating the UX and looking for improvements to make.</p>

        <p>This is one of my favorite recent photos, taken outside our office door just last week. Sometimes it is refreshing and needed to step away from the creative demands of a job and find inspiration elsewhere!</p>
